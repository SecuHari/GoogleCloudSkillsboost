Overview
TensorFlow is an open source, powerful, portable machine learning (ML) library developed by Google that can work with very large datasets. In this lab, you will create and train a computer vision model to recognize different items of clothing using TensorFlow Vertex AI Workbench.

Introduction to TensorFlow
TensorFlow provides a computational framework for building ML models. TensorFlow provides a variety of different toolkits that allow you to construct models at your preferred level of abstraction. In this lab you'll use tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train a neural network for classifying images in TensorFlow.
