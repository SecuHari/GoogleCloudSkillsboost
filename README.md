## 📌 Overview

In this lab, I trained a computer vision model using **TensorFlow** and **Fashion MNIST** dataset to recognize different types of clothing items like shirts, shoes, trousers, etc.

We built, compiled, trained, evaluated, and saved a neural network model using `tf.keras`.

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Load and preprocess image dataset  
✅ Design and compile a neural network model  
✅ Train the model for multiple epochs  
✅ Evaluate accuracy on test (unseen) data  
✅ Save and load the trained model  
✅ Use callbacks to stop early if accuracy is high  
✅ Experiment with layers and neurons
